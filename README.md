# Ecdysis

Simple interactive Python script for scaling images without affecting aspect ratio.

### Installation

Ensure python3 is installed by running the following from the terminal (UNIX-based systems):

```
python3 --version
```

Install python3 if it is missing; see [this article](https://realpython.com/installing-python/) if you need help.

This script depends on Pillow, an image processing library. Installation instructions [here](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/basic-installation.html).

Once these dependencies are installed, download the script via: 

```
git clone https://github.com/cmac038/ecdysis.git
```

### Usage

1. Run `python3 path/to/ecdysis.py`
2. Input the path to the original image (either absolute path or from current directory).
3. Follow prompts to scale your image!

**Note: The scaled image will be saved as a PNG to the directory from which the script is run.**
